# Cleaner-Py

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Installation

This script only uses one external library [send2trash](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py --flag
```

For now you can pass two flags

`--flutter` => will delete all the build directoryies found.

`--node` => will delete all the node-modules folder found.
